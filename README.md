This Jupyter Notebook project contains a machine learning logistic regression (classification) model which predicts whether a type of food with some given nutritional values given by the user is healthy or not.

The file has multiple boxes, which should be run in order in Jupyter Notebook. Here you can find a tutorial on how to run a Jupyter Notebook project https://youtu.be/r8BXJdE9ChE?si=lSu5zIOUttVggt0r, but there are plenty other tutorials on Youtube. Note that you should first clone the repository on your machine.
There are 25 input data examples, each with their own features (input) and their class (healthy/unhealthy) - denoted by 0(unhealthy) or 1(healthy) (output) given in a csv file. The user can also see how different models provide different errors and then can input some personal features and run the model to predict if the food whith those nutritional values is healthy or not.
All the other details of the structure and the algorithms are explained next to the code in every box.
